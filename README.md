# 🧠 AI Red Team Toolkit

Welcome to my personal AI-Enhanced Red Teaming Toolkit — built to streamline penetration test engagements using local AI, real-time CLI parsing, and Zettlr-based reporting.

This toolkit powers my workflow for:
- 🛠️ HTB / TryHackMe box writeups
- 📋 eJPT, PNPT, OSCP prep
- 📂 Zettlr markdown archiving
- 🤖 Local Mistral/CodeLlama AI support via Ollama
- 🔍 Real-time terminal parsing to generate `.md` reports
